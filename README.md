## 🧪 Playwright Python Project – Beginner Friendly Setup

This project uses **Playwright** and **Python** to test websites automatically. Follow these simple steps to set it up and run tests on your own computer.

---

### ✅ What You Need First

Make sure these are installed:

* ✅ Python (version 3.8 or higher) → [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* ✅ Git → [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. 📂 Download the Project

Open a terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

#### 2. 🛡️ Create a Virtual Environment

This helps to keep your project clean and separate from other Python projects.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You’ll see the virtual environment is activated if your terminal shows `(venv)` at the beginning.

#### 3. 📦 Install All Required Packages

Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Playwright and other useful tools.

#### 4. 🌐 Install Browsers (Only Once)

Run this to install the browsers Playwright uses (like Chrome):

```bash
playwright install
```

---

### ✅ How to Run the Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_example.py
```

You can change `test_example.py` to your file name.

---

### 🧾 Extra: Generate Report (Optional)

If you have HTML or Allure reports set up, you can run:

```bash
pytest --html=report.html
```

Then open the file `report.html` in your browser.
